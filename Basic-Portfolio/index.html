I had a vasectomy procedure in February(No kids, trying to keep it that way.) Got married in March to a beautiful young woman.  And was (voluntarily) fired in April from my general management postion with a wholesale florist.  I was promoted just last labor day to move to Pennsauken, NJ- right over the bridge from Philadelphia.  I experienced my first true winter as I am born and raised in Florida.  All the yankees said it was a mild winter, with that said, I don't want to experience any harsh winters.  Being a boss is a blast.  The stress is always there and the more money you make, the more responsibility you take.  I wouldn't change the experience for anything, but certainly glad to be out of the chaotic grind of the floral industry and not dealing with anymore "floral emergencies."  I have been "coding" since the seventh grade.  I turned down an opportunity while living in Jacksonville to work with Kenny Harper on mobile web development.  Looking forward to the challenge of pushing technological boundaries and innovating the world in which we live.</p></div>
